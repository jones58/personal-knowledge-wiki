# Sequence in programming is a set of instructions performed in order,
# with each executed in turn

"Predict, then Run, and Investigate and modify"

# To DO:
print(2 * 2)   # Predict then Run, and Investigate
print()   # Modify to use a different operator
print()   # Modify to use a different operator
print()  # Make : Use a different number and/or operator

# \n = newline

print("Refactored code\n")
"Predict, then Run, and Investigate"
#To DO: What is dfferent in the terminal when the code below ise executed?
print(2 * 3, "\n", 2 + 3, "\n", 2 / 3, "\n", 21 - 3)

# The python interpreter prints anything as it is, if placed between speech marks/ quotations
print("My name is Abdul\nWelcome to python programming")

print("\nThis is Python Bootcamp")

# format print output
print("The answer to 2 x 3 =", 2 * 3)

#To DO: Exercise: use the print statement to print
# Your name
# Your address
# Your interests
# format your print function to print your details above in three separate lines
# Perform either addition or calculation with two numbers
# Use text (format your output) in your addition"

"Share your solution as screenshot in nearpod collaboration board"

"Note: If stuck with formating print statement , refer to the printFuncsFormats.py file"

"To DO:Extension: Research"
#What is variable in python
#Modify your program to use variables instead of hard coded values
