[VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) - If you use Vue 2/3 for frontend design, vueuse is a fantastic TypeScript library that simplifies adding a wide range (200+ functions!!) of fully treeshakeable functionality to your code, including common helper functions, wrappers for adding reactivity to existing objects and functions, and more! - - It's regularly updated and tested, and it's by far one of the most useful libraries I've stumbled across for speeding up building frontends - if only for the time saved having to hunt down individual libraries for specific functionality that haven't been abandoned. -

- What if I use React? - If you're a React user, there are similar libraries available, such as react-use , and ahooks - though I haven't used either myself, and can't personally comment on how they compare - both appear to be have been updated fairly recently though. - - react-use: [Webpack App](https://streamich.github.io/react-use) - ahooks: [useUrlState - ahooks 3.0](https://ahooks.js.org/)
